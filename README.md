# Matrix-calculator
A Python matrix tool.
The goal is to make a compact matrix tool that can be included onto a calculator. So, best is to have the whole program in a single file.
Of course, as it's written in Python, it will be compatible with PC as well.

## Functionnalities

Program will be able to calculate the determinant, the inverse and the square of a given matrix.
It will also be able to add, substract and multiply two matrices.

A must would be to make combinations as well (like 3A + 2B = X, or even A^2 + 3A + 5B = X), as it's often asked in maths problems.
